So, you decide to buy a house but you have no idea what the process is like? In this blog I will try to give you a brief overview of the terms that you will come across when you are buying a house in Kathmandu. I will try to keep it as simple as possible. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I will try to answer them to the best of my knowledge.

**Brokers (à¤¦à¤²à¤¾à¤²)**
    
You will most probably need a broker if you are searching for a house to buy since finding the house is quite a difficult task in itself. I would suggest you to reach out to as many brokers as you want since most of them do not charge the buyer for their services. They charge the seller. But, please do clarify this with them before receiving their services. And great thing about this process is that you can ask them about the entire process and they will tell you how things work. Luckily I found a nice guy who was helping me throughout the process and he did not charge me a penny. He even bargained to some extent with the sellers ðŸ˜€. Let me know if you want his contact number.

This reminds me, if you like the house and are willing to go ahead with the purchase, PLEASE DO BARGAIN CRAZY !! If the seller says he is willing to sell it for 3 crores, POLITELY set your price to around 2.50 or 2.60. It gives you a breathing ground. I know this sounds like a huge cut but the fact is that the sellers keep a huge margin in houses. Trust me, when you both come to a middle ground and agree on the price, you will be thankful that you set your price low.
    
**Baina/Baina batta**
    
Before moving ahead with this section. Please do make sure you have done your due diligence about the house, land and overall details in general. You will have to verify who the house belongs to, if the land is guthi or raikad, and the entire history of the land and other things. You can do this by asking the photocopy of the Lalpurja from the house owner and heading to the Malpot office. Besides this, also ask the photocopy of the house designs/maps and reach out to an engineer just to be on the safe side. For newer houses that are built in Kathmandu at least, you are mostly safe since the land on which the construction will be taking place is not approved until a set of criteria is checked (Mapdanda).
