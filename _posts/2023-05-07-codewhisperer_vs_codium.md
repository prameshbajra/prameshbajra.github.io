**TLDR;** AWS CodeWhisperer is shit! Use Codium.

<br>
Here are the links and how to get started:

**AWS CodeWhisperer**
    
In order to use this, you will have to install the [AWS toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode). After the installation head to the sidebar, select the AWS toolkit and click on CodeWhisperer. You will need to follow a couple of super simple steps and it will start working right away.

**Codium**
    
Simply install this extension from this link [https://codeium.com/vscode_tutorial](https://codeium.com/vscode_tutorial). After the installation, you should get a popup for logging in after which you are ready. Simple as that!

Let me jump right to the point. There are several things I loved about Codium that CodeWhisperer lacked. Here are some of them:

- The **autocomplete/suggestions are far better.** In simple terms, more common sense, it gets what I want to do. It rarely suggests weird/garbage code snippets.

- **Daily updates**. The developers are really pushing out features and fixes fast. There is an update almost every day which is great to see considering how fast things have been moving in the AI space.

- You might find this interesting. It’s the option that shows over every function. This is what I mean.

<br>
Besides the things I love about Codium. It is feature packed as well.

1. It **works for a wide range of IDEs**. Just to name a few: VSCode, JetBrains, Intellj, Jupyter / Colab / Deepnote / Databricks Notebooks, Chrome, Vim / Neovim, Emacs, VSCode Web IDEs (ex. Gitpod)

2. It supports many languages. In fact around **70+ programming languages**. This is more than what any other code assistant support.

3. The code is private to you. It is **not used to train models** or whatsoever. They never train generative models on private codebases.

<br><br>
Ok enough about Codium,

There are two features in particular that **CodeWhisperer** has that I found interesting. One was the **code scan feature** that scans for potential bugs and vulnerabilities and the other is `cmd+c` shortcut trigger for getting code completions.

**What’s next?**

There is one major thing that is to be tried and tested. It’s Github Co-pilot. I have been hearing a lot of good things from people in twitter and reddit about it. It is said to have a code completion with lower latency even in complex scenarios.
