Using a small code snippet in __VBScript__ we can make our computer talk to us or let's just say greet us everytime our computer is turned on.


To make this happen follow the instruction:<br>

- Open any text editor and paste the code below and save it as “__name.vbs__”. Remember that the extension must be “__.vbs__” but the filename can be anything you want.

- Copy the below given code into the file you just created.


     >  `Set Sapi = Wscript.CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")` 
>
>  `dim str`
>
>  `if hour(time) < 12 then`
>
>  `Sapi.speak "Good Morning , Nice to see you. "`
>
>  `else`
>
>  `if hour(time) > 12 then`
>
>  `if hour(time) > 16 then`
>
>  `Sapi.speak "Good evening, Nice to see you."`
>
>  `else`
>
>  `Sapi.speak "Good afternoon, Nice to see you."`
>
>  `end if`
>
>  `end if`
>
>  `end if` 



- Goto __C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\\__ and paste the above made “__name.vbs__” file here.

Now everytime you turn your computer on, it will greet you with different messsages according to the time.

Feel free to modify the code and configure this accordingly.
