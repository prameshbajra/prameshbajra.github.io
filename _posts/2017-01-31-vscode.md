__Visual Studio Code__ is a source code editor developed by __Microsoft__ for _Windows, Linux and macOS_. It is based on __Electron__, a framework which is used to deploy Node.js applications for the desktop running on the Blink layout engine.

It was announced on _April 29, 2015 by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference_. On _April 14, 2016_, it was released to public. The source code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/).

So why do I love this text editor? Simple answer would be "Coz it's awesomme." 
Let's see some cool features : <br>

- The UI/UX is amazing. You have to try this for yourself to see it. I'm confident you will love it. If you want to customize further on then you are provided with hundreds of themes in __Extension__ tab.

    Here is a sample screenshot.

- It falls on the sweet spot between simple light code editor and a IDE. It's fast, light and has features like __Always-On IntelliSense__, __Side-by-Side Editing__, __Huge Language Support__ and blah blah blah!

- I'm a huge fan of __Integrated Version Control__ feature. This is very handy for _staging_, _commiting_ and _reverting_.

- Another cool thing is that it has __Integrated Terminal__ which opens up many terminal windows on the bottom of the screen. You can toggle this by `` Ctrl + ` ``.

- There is another great feature called __Peek__ which is toggled by `Shift + F12`. While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.
With __Peek__, you can select a function then hit `Shift + F12`. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. The feature currently works in _C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, .NET,_ and a few other programming languages.

- __Rename All Occurrences__ . Refactoring is a necessary aspect of writing and maintaining clean code, but it can be quite the headache — especially when you’re refactoring a large module or an otherwise huge chunk of code. So instead of hunting through dozens of files just to rename a variable or method, let VS Code do it for you.
If you select a variable/method and hit F2, you can edit the name and it will change every instance of that variable’s name throughout the entire current working project.
If you only want to change within the current file, use the Command + F2 (on Mac) or Ctrl + F2 (on Windows) keyboard shortcut and VS Code will spawn a cursor at every instance throughout the current file.

- __Live Share__. VS Code Live Share is a brand new feature that is still just in developer preview. It allows you to share your workspace in realtime, live editing, pin to the user to follow their cursor, group debugging and many more. It’s really helpful if you work remotely or when you need to collaborate with someone who isn’t around.

- __Edit Multiple Lines at Once__. If you ever need to insert or delete multiple instances of text throughout a document, all you have to do is create multiple cursors. You can do this by holding down Option (on Mac) or Alt (on Windows) and clicking anywhere in the text. Every click creates a new cursor.
This is particularly useful for things like HTML, where you might want to add many instances of the same class or change the format of several hyperlinks.



- Extensions are editor's best friend. __VS Code__ has a market full of these which can help you get coding easily. [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) is the link for the market if interested. Some must have for me are :

> Note : Before __VS Code__ I used __Sublime text__ and __Atom__. Both were kinda nice but it wasn't the best for me. __VS Code__ is where I am settled for now. It's fast and comfortable to use. I can't think of any other reason why I should be switching. "Good work __Microsoft__, you guys nailed it" , I'd say.

These are some cool things I like about __VS Code__. Feel free to shoot me a mail or comment to let me know about your favorite feature, extension or theme.
